# Intro
Working on this to eventually showcase my ability to learn and implement as needed.<br />
Prior to working on this I knew jinja existed and that it was for creating templates. Now<br />
although I have a lot left to learn if I continue, I am able to serve a webpage via multiple<br />
jinja template pieces.

## Current Project
Creating a modular data pipeline tool. The goal of this project is to create an adaptable pipeline<br />
handle any data from any source with minimal input. This includes SQL queries populated dynamically<br />
with few required arguments. For instance, when creating a table the query takes the table name and<br />
columns from the file name and data, respectively, unless specified. I'm hoping to design the structure<br />
in a way that enables each piece to run or skip based on what has already been created, ie tables, files,<br />
visualizations, etc.
